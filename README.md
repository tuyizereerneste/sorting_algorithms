# sorting_algorithms

TASKS

1. Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm
	Prototype: void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size)
You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements.

2. Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm
	Prototype: void insertion_sort_list(listint_t **list)
You are not allowed to modify the integer n of a node. You have to swap the nodes themselves.
You’re expected to print the list after each time you swap two elements

3. Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm
	Prototype: void selection_sort(int *array, size_t size)
You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements

4. Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm
	Prototype: void quick_sort(int *array, size_t size);
You must implement the Lomuto partition scheme.
The pivot should always be the last element of the partition being sorted.
You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements
